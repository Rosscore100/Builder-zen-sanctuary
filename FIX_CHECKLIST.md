# 🔧 Pre-Upload Fix Checklist

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Fix Before HostGator Upload

### 1. 🖼️ **Logo Image - BROKEN**

**Current:** Loading from builder.codes URL (won't work on HostGator)

```

```

**Fix Needed:**

- Replace with your actual logo file
- Place logo in `public/` folder as `logo.png`
- Or update the src path in Header.jsx

**Location:** `src/components/Header.jsx` line 37

---

### 2. 🔗 **Navigation Links - NOT WORKING**

**Problem:** Header navigation shows as text, not clickable links

**Current Issue:** Navigation items are displaying but not functioning as links

**Fix Needed:** Check React Router Link components in Header.jsx

**Location:** `src/components/Header.jsx` navigation section

---

### 3. 📧 **Email Links - CHECK NEEDED**

**Current:** `admin@digitalplatform.online`

**Locations to verify:**

- Footer contact section
- Contact page form
- Any mailto: links

**Action:** Update with your actual email address

---

### 4. 🔘 **Hero Section Buttons**

**Current:** "Explore Resources" and "Get Started" buttons

**Check:** Ensure they link to correct pages:

- Explore Resources → `/resources`
- Get Started → `/contact`

**Location:** `src/components/Hero.jsx`

---

### 5. 🌐 **Social Media Links - PLACEHOLDER**

**Current:** All social links point to "#" (placeholder)

**Fix Needed:** Update with real social media URLs:

- LinkedIn
- Twitter/X
- GitHub

**Locations:**

- Footer component
- Contact page

---

### 6. 📞 **Contact Information**

**Current placeholder text to update:**

- "Global Digital Solutions"
- "Worldwide Remote Services"
- Phone numbers (if needed)
- Physical address (if needed)

**Location:** `src/components/Footer.jsx`

---

### 7. 📝 **Content Text to Customize**

**Company/Brand Names:**

- "Digital Platform" (replace with your business name)
- Mission statements
- Service descriptions
- About page content

**Hero Section:**

- "Transform Your Digital Presence"
- Subtitle text
- Call-to-action text

---

### 8. 🎨 **Images & Media**

**Missing/Placeholder Images:**

- Logo (main priority)
- Service icons (currently using emojis)
- Any hero graphics
- Team photos (if needed)

---

### 9. 🔧 **Form Functionality**

**Contact Form:** Currently shows alert message

- Needs email service integration (FormSpree, EmailJS, etc.)
- Or PHP contact form for HostGator

**Location:** `src/pages/ContactPage.jsx`

---

### 10. 📱 **Domain References**

**Check for hardcoded URLs that need updating:**

- Any absolute URLs pointing to builder.codes
- Update with your actual domain
