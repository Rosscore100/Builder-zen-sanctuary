# Logo Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup:

1. Replace this file with your logo image
2. Name it exactly: `logo.png`
3. Recommended size: 200x80 pixels (or similar ratio)
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG

## If you want to use the logo image:

Update `src/components/Header.jsx` around line 27:

```jsx
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Digital Platform" className="logo-image" />
```

## Current Status:

- Text logo is active: "Digital Platform" with gradient styling
- Ready to switch to image logo when you add your file

Your site works perfectly without a logo image!
